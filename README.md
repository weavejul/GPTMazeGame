# GPTMazeGame
A proof of concept from high school (2020), showing how LLMs could be used to generate dynamic dialogue for games. I created a 2D, procedurally generated dungeon crawler from scratch, and populated it with GPT3-driven dialogue. Each NPC had a randomly generated system prompt that dictated its personality and behavior towards the user.

This game requires an OpenAI API key. Insert this in place of "YOUR-OPENAI-KEY-HERE" in the env file in ProgramFiles.
