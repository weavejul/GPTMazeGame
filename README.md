# GPTMazeGame
A proof of concept from high school, showing how NLP transformers could be used to generate dialogue for a game. I created a 2D, randomly generated dungeon crawler from scratch, and populated it with GPT3-driven dialogue.

The game requires an OpenAI API key. Insert this in place of "YOUR-OPENAI-KEY-HERE" in the env file in ProgramFiles.
